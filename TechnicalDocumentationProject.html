                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Short Introduction</h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 5%; max-width: 1300px; text-indent: 5%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are a very infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue.
    The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.
    Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the Sea and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other. They then reunited and have since continued to be a dynamic force in the New World, greatly disrupting the balance of the Three Great Powers, which would eventually lead to their captain being recognized as one of the Four Emperors.
    They are the main focus and protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece and are led by the main protagonist Monkey D. Luffy.

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; max-width: 1300px; text-indent: 5%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters. He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King, which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers, and crew. He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.
Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army, and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, and their family carries the initial and Will of D.. At age 7, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which turned his body into rubber. Shanks also gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday after he became a great pirate. Growing up on Dawn Island under the care of Curly Dadan, Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo.
Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line, emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. He invaded and indirectly caused the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaped the impregnable Impel Down, and was a focal figure in the Summit War of Marineford. He has also either defeated or befriended seven of the eleven known past or present Warlords prior to the organization's dissolution. Furthermore, Luffy has invaded the territory of the Four Emperors on multiple occasions, and eventually managed to defeat one. Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element" while in the process gaining a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane," earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters, and even the World Government.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Roronoa Zoro</h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 5%; max-width: 1300px; text-indent: 5%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.
Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a matrilineal descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.
In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, Zoro, alongside his captain are included among the ranks of the "Worst Generation", pirates who simultaneously reached the Sabaody Archipelago with bounties of over Beli 100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War, as well as Marshall D. Teach.
Zoro gained his first bounty of Beli 60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to Beli 120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to Beli 320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli 1,111,000,000.

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; max-width: 1300px; text-indent: 5%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    "Black Leg" Sanji, born as Vinsmoke Sanji, is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.
                    Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus, making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
                    His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio".
                    He first gained a bounty of Beli 77,000,000 for his role in the raid on Enies Lobby. It increased to Beli 177,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only Alive due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped from Big Mom's territory, his bounty condition was reverted back to Dead or Alive, and its value increased to Beli 330,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli 1,032,000,000. Despite renouncing his surname Vinsmoke, the World Government labels it as part of his name on his wanted poster.

However, she legitimately joined the Straw Hats after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.
She first gained a bounty of Beli 16,000,000 following the raid on Enies Lobby. It later increased to Beli 66,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to Beli 366,000,000.

Usopp is the son of Yasopp and Banchina. He was born and raised in Syrup Village, serving as "captain" of the Usopp Pirates and being Kaya's close friend. After working with the Straw Hats to defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he was invited to join the crew. Despite his usual cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave warrior of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of living up to this dream.
He first gained a bounty of Beli 30,000,000 under his Sogeking Persona after the incident at Enies Lobby. After the Dressrosa Arc, Usopp gained a bounty of Beli 200,000,000 under his own name. Following the events from the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was raised to Beli 500,000,000.

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; max-width: 1300px; text-indent: 5%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    Tony Tony Chopper, also known as "Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper, is the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the sixth member of the crew and the fifth to join, doing so at the end of the Drum Island Arc.

He was taught how to be a doctor on Drum Island by his two parental figures, Doctors Hiriluk and Kureha. His dream is to one day become a doctor capable of curing any disease and wants to travel all across the world specifically in the hopes of accomplishing this dream.
He gained his first bounty of Beli 50 after the incident at Enies Lobby due to being mistaken for the crew's pet. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to Beli100, then to Beli 1,000 following the Raid on Onigashima.

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; max-width: 1300px; text-indent: 5%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    Nico Robin, also known by her epithet "Devil Child" and the "Light of the Revolution", is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.
Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government.
She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All Sunday", serving and partnering herself directly with the organization's president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.
She gained a bounty of Beli 79,000,000 at the age of 8 due to her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara. It later increased to Beli 80,000,000 after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to Beli 130,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to Beli 930,000,000.

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; max-width: 1300px; text-indent: 5%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    "Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the crew's eighth member and the seventh to join, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.
                    Born "Cutty Flam", he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until eventually permanently discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. Originally from the South Blue, Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old, eventually making his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty hunters.
                    Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's dream is to create a ship and circumnavigate the world with it, and he built the Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his dream.
                    He gained a bounty of Beli 44,000,000 for his involvement at the Enies Lobby Incident. It later increased to Beli 94,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli 394,000,000.

                    "Soul King" Brook is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the ninth member of the crew and the eighth to join, doing so at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc.
Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life after death once. Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him significant control over his own soul and the souls of others.
Originally a member of the Rumbar Pirates, he died and was resurrected through the power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. However, due to the amount of time it took for his soul to find his body, it was reduced to a skeleton, keeping only his afro intact. Brook drifted alone in the Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually meeting Luffy and serving as the Straw Hats' ally during the Thriller Bark Arc before officially joining the crew. His dream is to reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse Mountain, where he resides with Crocus.
He first gained a bounty of Beli 33,000,000 during his time as a member of the Rumbar Pirates. It later increased to Beli 83,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli 383,000,000.

                    "Knight of the Sea" Jinbe is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the Wano Country Arc.
Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Summit War of Marineford. Vegapunk later cloned Jinbe as one of the Seraphim, S-Shark, to replace the Warlords.
Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc. After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew.
He first gained a bounty of Beli 76,000,000 due to him being a member of the Sun Pirates. It was later increased to Beli 250,000,000 after Jinbe became the new captain of the Sun Pirates before it was frozen after he joined the Seven Warlords. Upon resigning his position as a Warlord at the Summit War of Marineford, his bounty was reinstated at Beli 438,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli 1,100,000,000.
